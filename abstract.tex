Calculating defects in solids using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster.
=======================================================================

In this seminar we will talk about using coupled-cluster methods in order to
calculate ground and excited states of defects in periodic systems using
plane waves as a basis set.
Defects are important both as a theoretical benchmark system and for practical
applications in industry. We will present some calculations of optical
excitation energies for color centers and comment some future directions in
this area.

Special care will be taken in order to make the presentation intelligible to
researchers with a chemistry background. Therefore, the talk will be held in a
pedagogical manner striving to be self-contained.
